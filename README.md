# Restructuring CSS And HTML Code To Improve Accesibility

## Description

    Improving the accesibility of a website within CSS and HTML is crutial for making it more accessible to any developer that takes a look into your code. What I did to refactor the code was fixing bugs like links and display structure, added comments and re-orginized the html and css in semantic structure to make it easier to navigate. 

 ## Usage
    
    The Usage of Semantic structure and cleaning up the code by adding comments and reorginizing is to make it more accessible to the user and easier to navigate.
